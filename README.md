## Pig Solitaire

Pig solitaire is a game where a player is given a chance to roll a 6-sided die.  If they roll a 1, their turn is over, if they roll a 2-6, that number is added to their turn score. After their initial roll, they are given the choice of whether or not to roll again.  Each time they roll, their score is added to their turn score.  However, if at any time during the turn they roll a 1, they forfeit all of their turn points, and no points are added to their total.  The game can be played for as many rounds as one pleases.

The point of this project is to find the optimal strategy for choosing whether or not to roll again to maximize one's turn points.
